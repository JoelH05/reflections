When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local when you are collaborating with other users in a team.
This way you and them have access to changes and can update certain parts.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 
  
  Because if you are collaborating with a team there might be changes that you add or that someone else does that you don't want in your file yet. It allows you to control the change that go into your local repository and what doesn't.
