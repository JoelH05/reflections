When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local when you are collaborating with other users in a team.
This way you and them have access to changes and can update certain parts.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 
  
  Because if you are collaborating with a team there might be changes that you add or that someone else does that you don't want in your file yet. It allows you to control the change that go into your local repository and what doesn't.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

   A fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub. Use this when you want to make changes to a repository when you don't have access to the original repository.
    A clone is copy of a repository. This can be on the same machine, but it can also be a clone from a GitHub repository to your own machine. Use this for collaborating.
    Branches are leafs on the master branch. Those can be seen as a side track in which you can change code without changing the master branch. Use this for creating new features/bug fixes.
